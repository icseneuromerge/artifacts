\section{Conclusions}

The evolution of ML for compilers requires more expressive representations. We
show that current techniques cannot reason about simple data flows which are at
the core of all compilers. We present \programl, a graph-based representation
for programs derived from compiler IRs that accurately captures the semantics of
a program's statements and the relations between them. We are releasing the
\textsc{DeepDataFlow} dataset as a community benchmark for evaluating approaches
to learning over programs. \programl and \textsc{DeepDataFlow} open up new
directions for research towards more flexible and useful program analysis.
\programl outperforms the state-of-the-art, but is limited by scalability issues
imposed by MPNNs. In highlighting the limitations of our approach we wish to
expedite future research to address key challenges that are faced in the domain
of program analysis. As future work, we will investigate how MPNNs could be
improved to learn efficient and stable fixed-point algorithms, regardless of
input graph size.
